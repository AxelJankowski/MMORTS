# MMORTS
Online multiplayer strategy game played in a browser

Created in the image of games like Tribal Wars and/or Travian. It involves (or will involve) establishing and expanding settlements as well as trading and fighting with other players.
Inspired by tutorials of JebCoding on YouTube. I consider it as a development of my PHP skills.

I use a bit of Bootstrap for styling to be able to focus on functionality.
